Overview
- This project hosts a trading bot designed to operate on Binance futures markets, focusing on rapid scalping strategies and price arbitrage opportunities. It aims to help traders explore how micro-movements in perpetual and quarterly futures can be captured with careful risk controls and disciplined execution.
- The codebase emphasizes clarity, direct operation, and straightforward configuration. It favors explicit steps over magic in order to keep behavior predictable and auditable.

Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or newer
- A Binance Futures account with API access
- An API key that has futures trading permissions

Why these prerequisites matter
- Python 3.7+ ensures modern language features and reliable library support used by the bot.
- A Binance Futures account provides the markets and margins the bot relies on for orders.
- Proper API permissions limit risk and help ensure that the bot can place and manage orders as intended.

Key ideas behind the bot
- The bot continuously reads price data from Binance futures, identifies favorable conditions for scalping and arbitrage, and places orders within the configured limits.
- It uses a modular approach so you can adapt parts of the logic without rewriting the whole system.
- The design favors safety, with checks to prevent excessive leverage usage and to avoid crossing into high-risk scenarios.

Installation

1) Clone the repository and move into the project directory

- Command:
  - git clone https://github.com/marahman30104/binance-scalping.git
  - cd binance-scalping

2) Install dependencies

- Command:
  - pip install -r requirements.txt

3) Configure environment variables

- Copy the example environment file and set your credentials:
  - cp .env.example .env
  - Open .env and enter your Binance API key, secret, and any other required settings

Why environment variables
- Keeping credentials out of code helps reduce exposure and makes it easier to switch credentials or use different accounts for testing.

Trading Parameters

The bot accepts a set of command line options that control how it runs. The intent is to give you precise control over risk, scale, and timing.

- --symbol: The trading pair to use on Binance futures (for example BTCUSDC, ETHUSDC, or similar)
- --quantity: The order size per trade. For example, 0.1 means 0.1 units of the base asset
- --take_profit: The price offset for profit taking. A value of 0.5 places a take-profit limit at the opening price plus $0.50
- --max-orders: The maximum number of orders the bot can hold at once
- --wait-time: How long to wait between placing consecutive orders (in seconds)
- --dry-run: Run without executing real trades; useful for testing
- --log-level: Set the verbosity of logs (e.g., INFO, DEBUG, WARNING)
- --env: Choose which environment to run in (e.g., mainnet or testnet)
- --base-url: Override the Binance API endpoint if you need a custom route
- --retry-count: How many times to retry a failed order
- --retry-delay: Delay between retries (in seconds)

Note: The exact parameter set can evolve. Check the command line help in the latest release for the current options:
- Command: python -m binance_scalping --help

How it works (high level)

- Data ingestion: The bot subscribes to price streams from Binance futures, keeping a live view of market depth and recent trades.
- Decision logic: It evaluates opportunities based on predefined criteria such as spread, price drift, and order book depth. The logic aims to identify opportunities with a favorable risk/reward profile.
- Execution: When a suitable opportunity is found, the bot places one or more orders, subject to the maximum concurrency limit. It also sets corresponding take-profit levels to lock in gains.
- Risk controls: The bot includes guards against overleveraging and against placing orders in illiquid markets. It respects the configured wait times and maximum orders to avoid flood conditions.
- Monitoring: The system logs important events and outcomes, enabling you to audit decisions and performance.

Configuration and Environment

- API keys and secrets should be stored in the .env file. Never commit credentials to source control.
- The bot supports a test environment. Use testnet settings during development to minimize risk and avoid real capital during experimentation.
- Logging is enabled by default. You can adjust the log level to reduce verbosity when running in production.

Environment variables to know about

- BINANCE_API_KEY: Your Binance API key
- BINANCE_API_SECRET: Your Binance secret
- USE_TESTNET: true or false to toggle test mode
- API_BASE_URL: The base URL for the Binance API; useful if you run a self-hosted gateway
- LOG_FILE: Path to a log file for persistent logs
- MAX_SLIPPAGE: A cap to guard against unexpected price movements
- ORDER_TIMEOUT: How long the bot waits for order fills before canceling

Getting started with a quick run

- Ensure dependencies are installed
- Copy and configure the environment file
- Run with a simple configuration to verify basics

- Example:
  - python -m binance_scalping --symbol BTCUSDC --quantity 0.1 --take_profit 0.5 --max-orders 5 --wait-time 2

Notes on testing and safety
- Use the testnet when testing new strategies or parameter sets.
- Start with small quantities to observe behavior without risking large sums.

Trading Parameters Deep Dive

- Symbol: The symbol defines the trading pair. Binance uses specific naming for Perpetual Futures vs Flex contracts. Confirm the exact symbol on your local setup before enabling live trading.
- Quantity: The unit size per order, which controls exposure per trade. If you trade ETHUSDC and set quantity to 0.1, the bot will attempt to place trades for 0.1 ETH per order.
- Take Profit: This value defines how far the bot should look to lock in profits. The bot places a closing order at opening price plus the offset. This helps automate exit strategies.
- Max Orders: The limit on concurrent active orders. It helps maintain manageable risk and system load.
- Wait Time: The interval between order attempts. It reduces the chance of overly aggressive order placement and helps align with liquidity.
- Dry Run: The mode to simulate trades. It helps verify logic, timing, and risk controls without real funds.
- Log Level: Controls how much detail is written to logs. Debug mode is useful during development.
- Environment: Lets you switch between production and testing environments.
- Base URL: Useful if you point the bot at a proxy or custom gateway.
- Retry and Delay: Finite retries with a delay to improve resilience while avoiding rapid-fire retries.

Running tests and validating behavior

- Run unit tests from the tests/ directory using your preferred test runner (for example, pytest).
- Validate strategies in a controlled environment before live deployment.
- Review logs after each run to verify that the bot’s decisions align with expectations.

Usage patterns and examples

- Quick start: A minimal invocation for a simple, single-symbol operation
  - python -m binance_scalping --symbol BTCUSDC --quantity 0.05 --take_profit 0.25 --max-orders 3 --wait-time 1
- Dry run for exploration: A test-mode run to observe behavior
  - python -m binance_scalping --symbol ETHUSDC --quantity 0.1 --take_profit 0.4 --max-orders 2 --dry-run
- Production-like run with verbose logging:
  - python -m binance_scalping --symbol BTCUSDC --quantity 0.2 --take_profit 0.75 --max-orders 6 --wait-time 2 --log-level DEBUG

Monitoring, logging, and observability

- Logs: Critical events, decisions, and outcomes are logged with timestamps, symbols, and order identifiers.
- Metrics: The bot captures metrics such as filled orders, profits, and drawdown estimates to aid analysis.
- Alerts: If you set up a monitoring system, you can route key events to alert channels, enabling prompt responses to unusual conditions.

Error handling and resilience

- The bot includes retry logic for transient API errors. It respects configured delays to avoid hammering the exchange.
- If a critical failure occurs, the bot exits or falls back to a safe state depending on the error type and configuration.

Usage tips and best practices

- Start with a small quantity and a conservative take profit. This helps you learn how the bot behaves in live markets without exposing too much capital.
- Use the dry-run mode first to confirm the logic before enabling live trading.
- Keep your API keys secure and rotate them periodically.
- Regularly review the logs to confirm the bot’s decisions and performance.

Design decisions and architecture

- Modular design: Components are designed to be replaceable. If you want to swap data sources or adjust the decision logic, you can do so without rewriting all the code.
- Clear interfaces: Modules expose straightforward interfaces, reducing the risk of accidental coupling.
- Deterministic behavior: The decision rules are designed to be clear and auditable. This makes it easier to reason about trades and outcomes.

Code structure highlights

- Core engine: Handles price data, order placement, and state management.
- Risk module: Applies safety checks before sending orders.
- Strategy module: Encapsulates the scalping and arbitrage logic, making it easier to tweak or replace.
- I/O: Handles file-based configuration, environment variables, and log output.

Security and best practices

- Do not commit credentials to version control. Use environment variables or a secure vault.
- Use a dedicated trading account for automation to minimize risk to personal capital.
- Test thoroughly in a sandbox or test environment before risking real funds.

Testing and quality assurance

- Unit tests cover critical paths like order construction, fee calculations, and edge cases in pricing.
- Integration tests simulate end-to-end flow against a mock Binance API.
- Continuous integration workflows can run tests on each pull request to catch regressions early.

Troubleshooting common issues

- Connection errors: Check network access and firewall settings. Ensure API keys are valid and not expired.
- Invalid symbol errors: Verify the correct symbol naming on Binance for the selected market and time frame.
- Insufficient balance: Confirm the account balance in the testnet or live account enough to cover the order sizes and fees.
- Slippage too high: Reassess the max orders and wait times. Consider reducing quantity to stay within the volatility window.

Scaling and deployment considerations

- Hardware and environment: A modest server with reliable network connectivity suffices for many users. For higher-frequency activity or larger portfolios, ensure you have adequate compute and robust monitoring.
- Parallelism: The bot is designed to handle multiple orders concurrently but within safe limits. If you plan to scale, adjust the max-orders parameter and review rate limits from the exchange.
- Backups: Keep a copy of configuration and logs. In case of a crash, you can replay events and understand what happened.

Future directions and roadmap

- Enhanced risk controls: Add more granular risk checks such as dynamic position sizing, volatility-based limits, and liquidity-aware routing.
- Additional markets: Expand to support more futures products or alternative exchanges with reliable APIs.
- Improved analytics: Provide deeper insights into trade performance, fee structure, and historical wash-trade patterns.
- UX improvements: Create a simpler, guided setup flow with presets for common scenarios.
